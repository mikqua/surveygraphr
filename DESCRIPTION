Description: A tool for computing network representations of attitudes,
  extracted from tabular data such as sociological surveys. By treating
  a survey as a bipartite network, we measure the similarity between
  respondents and survey items to produce network edges. We do this in both a
  respondent network, as well as a survey item network. Used in combination
  with graph visualisation libraries, this techniques helps practitioners in the
  social sciences identify network structure that may be present within a
  survey at a glance.
