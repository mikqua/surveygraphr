### Using `make_synthetic_data` to simulate surveys

This will run examples of computing agent and symbolic layers. We have included the very simple `make_synthetic_data` function to simulate data with varying degrees of polarisation. You can set the following parameters:

| argument | meaning |
|:---------|:--------|
| `nrow` | number of agents in the survey |
| `ncol` | number of variables in the survey |
| `polarisation` | amount of multidimensional polarisation |
| `minority` | fraction of agents in one of the two groups |

Of course you can simulate data using your own algorithms as well.

We'll start by loading surveygraph

```r
#library(surveygraph)
```

Here we will simulate a sample of 150 people answering 1 item in a survey with no intentional polarisation:

```r
S <- make_synthetic_data(nrow=150, ncol=1, polarisation=0, minority =0.5)
```
