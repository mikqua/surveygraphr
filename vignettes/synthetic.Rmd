### Using make_synthetic_data() to simulate surveys

This will run examples of computing agent and symbolic layers. 

We have included the very basic make_synthetic_data function to simulate data with varying degrees of polarisation. You can set the following parameters:
* nrow = the number of agents in the simulated survey
* ncol = the number of variables in the simulated survey
* polarisation = the amount of multidimensional polarisation
* minority = approximate proportion of the sample in one of the two groups

Of course you can simulate data using your own algorithms as well.

Here we will simulate a sample of 150 people answering 1 item in a survey with no intentional polarisation:

```r
testdata_unpolarised <- make_synthetic_data(nrow=150, ncol=1, polarisation=0, minority =0.5)
```
